45. Respawning stuff for no tf_logic_arena.

50. Plugin information menu option that leads to a group post.

logic_branch dtk_activator_is_bot

Entity search tool. Menu that lists logic_relays, point_teleport, env_global. Restart round.

Training message to let mappers show stuff to players

Map author by Steam ID. Credits

Can spies use dropped ammo boxes from other players to refill cloak?
	Yes 

cvar for game description.

Add a way to return a player's speed to default using map logic. Check cvar values first.

Air accelerate and turbo physics cvars.

Simulate the m_bRegenerating private member variable/player property so we don't give weapons to someone who is regenerating.
We could set the property to true when we receive a class change instruction, or when they spawn.
If we need to give them weapons, we check if they are regenerating. If not, give them weapons. If they are, we add the
weapons to a global dynamic array and check again in one frame, or when the inventory event has been fired.

Separate map instructions to separate plugin.




Play Test

Bugs
====

No boss on first round? Could be caused by wrong state.

I somehow broke Arena mode when joining blue when there was already an activator. When the red bot died it didn't end the round.

Found a bug with DTK. If you join a team but don't choose a class, you will still be team swapped.
I was put on blue as the activator and had yet to choose a team, but was only able to spec from the Buzz train on PlayStation
and when I tried to choose a class and spawn after the round had started, the game told me I couldn't change class after the round had started.
	Possible fix: I set a player's class to a random one the moment they choose a team if their class is unknown.

When arriving on the server, if waiting for players time has finished, everyone is forced onto red and a round start event is never called.
	Fixed?

Overheal text remains on screen after blue guy dies.
	Test fix
Max health scale seems to give the activator more bounciness from damage.

Plugin doesn't select health bar target properly. Maybe have a global Player variable called activator.

Max health attribute carries over to next round and when it's removed it leaves an overheal. Need to remove attribute when the activator dies.
	Fixed by using an attribute trigger?
	Update: If using TF2 Attributes we'll need to reset.
	Update 2: Using TF2 Attr and removing all on spawn seems to fix this.

Three people on the server, two decided not to be activator, only one player was being picked by the points system.

If you award points to yourself display a different message instead of two.

Clean up ShowActivity for points award.
	Test fix
	
Opting out should set the points award flag to 0.
	Why? Oh well did it anyway
	
Items created are dropped on the ground when the player's inventory is refreshed.
	Testing m_hOwnerEntity

Can't give a player a secondary weapon if they are wearing soldier boots.
	Test in game
	
FireUser1 from the 'player' doesn't pass the client index as the activator. Instead we get the entity index of the entity that caused the output. e.g. tf_logic_arena.
	Test this in sandbox

I would like some way of delaying weapon grants until after Class regeneration. I don't want to make a requestframe callback function for every function that needs to do this.
	Dynamic array?

Seems RemovePlayerAttribute may not be working! Tried it with the Boost function and it didn't remove the attribute. Need to experiment.
	Could this be caused by the trigger not removing an attribute? Try it with TF2 Attributes enabled and disabled in Sandbox.
	
ChatMessage function isn't showing correct translation phrase when other language clients are on the server.
	Fixed using VFormat

Crappy reply sound in TF2C
	Replaced

TF2C: Spawned into a round in progress during Castle Steveh mini game and kept dying. Need to force a round win if one player.
	Try and emulate TF2 behaviour. See what that game does.

trigger_hurt minus figures doesn't update boss bar
	Check events. Consider hooking player damage/healing instead.

Boss bar shows as full if the activator is killed in one shot
	Write some more debug lines of code to check output. player_death may not be firing after player_hurt.

	This suggests the plugin is doing a spawn check when a player leaves. Check events.

Need a 'reply to command' console respons for my chat stocks.

Anti backstab didn't work after reloading the plugin mid game.

Anti backstab only takes off 100 HP, should be 300.

Check if weapons granted by the plugin are dropped when replaced.

The boss bar sometimes shows an overheal. I switched to Heavy from Engi and it said +175.

On the first round the activator selection systems do not fire.

A player can join blue during pre round time.

Jetpack game gives players the discipilinary action condition.

sm_draward causing exception report? Unknown command: sm_draward

When the player is killed by an obj_sentrygun2, the chat kill feed should say "an"

Not reverting to the QP system when only two players opt in ??





Observations
============

player_initial_spawn fires when the players first joins and lands on the MOTD. Seems to happen once per map/connection.
player_spawn and player_activate happen at the same time as this.

Setting activators to 2 and then slaying myself while on blue crashed the server.

If on a server alone and you spawn into a team then go to spec, the 'waiting' message is shown three times.

Activator can kill themselves with stickies.

'Next activators' shows people in spec.

'Next activators' should show correct order if turn-based system is being used.

A 5144 byte trie is created by morecolors.




Activator Selection and Redistribution Notes
============================================

1. Check the number of players. If not enough goto 2. if enough goto 5.
2. Print a message if there are not enough and go into a waiting state.
3. Watch for changes to teams
4. Recycle this function again if teams change.
5. Redistribute.

On round reset > Check players

What is the desired number of activators?
Are there at least 1+desired_activators players?

Yes > Swap people around using whichever system is active.

No > Print "Not enough players" and go on watch for team changes (global var in team_change event)

Need to replace activator if they leave.
When players have been moved, watch for changes. 
If a change occurs, check if we have desired_activators on blue team. If we do, do nothing. If we don't, run Check Players.

Bug:

When using more than one activator and the number of players in game is equal to that and someone leaves blue, teams
will not rebalance because there isn't an branch to deal with the situation. I think I need to come up with a better checking
system set of branches which has fallback for fewer activators than the required. But for now it's best to keep the
number of activators on 1.
